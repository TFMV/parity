# Parity

[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/TFMV/parity)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/TFMV/parity)

**Parity** is a high-performance data validation engine that ensures data consistency across heterogeneous systems. Built on **Apache Arrow** and **Go**, Parity delivers exceptional performance through vectorized operations and parallel processing. By leveraging ADBC (Arrow Database Connectivity), it enables seamless validation across modern data platforms with minimal overhead.

---

## üöÄ **Technical Vision**

Unlike traditional tools, Parity achieves unparalleled performance by combining Apache Arrow's columnar format with ADBC for truly heterogeneous system validation.

Parity addresses the challenges of modern data validation through a sophisticated technical architecture:

### Core Architecture

- **Vectorized Processing Engine**: Leverages Arrow's columnar format for SIMD operations
- **Parallel Validation Pipeline**: Distributes validation tasks across available cores
- **Zero-Copy Data Movement**: Minimizes memory overhead through Arrow's shared memory model
- **Pluggable Source Adapters**: ADBC-powered connectors for diverse data sources

### Key Technical Features

- **Schema Evolution Detection**: Tracks and validates schema changes across systems
- **Intelligent Sampling**: Statistical sampling for large dataset validation
- **Differential Validation**: Identifies and validates only changed data segments
- **Custom Validation Rules**: DSL for defining complex validation logic
- **Performance Profiling**: Built-in metrics for validation performance analysis

---

## üöÄ **Project Vision**

Data validation is critical for ensuring the integrity of data pipelines, but traditional tools often fall short in terms of performance and flexibility, especially when working across diverse platforms. Parity aims to solve these challenges by:

- Supporting **heterogeneous platform comparisons** with blazing-fast performance.
- Leveraging **Apache Arrow** to enable columnar, in-memory operations.
- Incorporating **ADBC connectivity** for streamlined interaction with modern data sources.
- Providing extensibility for additional platforms, formats, and schemas.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Current Status**

Parity is in active development, focusing on its core validation engine. The project follows a modular architecture that enables independent development of components:

- **Core Engine**: Arrow-based validation kernel
- **Connector Framework**: ADBC implementation layer
- **Rule Engine**: Validation rule parser and executor
- **API Layer**: gRPC/REST interfaces for service integration
